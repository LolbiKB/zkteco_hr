# Attendance rules (MVP → later engine)

This document defines **policy + rule logic** for turning raw device punches (ERPNext **Employee Checkin**) into daily outcomes (late flags, missing punches, hours, exceptions) for ZKTeco bridge employees.

It is intentionally **rules-only** (no implementation). The bridge currently sets `skip_auto_attendance = 1` on device punches to prevent ERP auto-attendance from creating `Attendance` before these rules are implemented.

**Implementation plan:** see [`FRAPPE_ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_PLAN.md`](./FRAPPE_ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_PLAN.md).

## Scope

- **In scope**: rule definitions, required data, expected outputs, and the review/approval workflow.
- **Out of scope**: building the scheduler/jobs, doctypes, UI, or payroll integrations.

## Prerequisites (must already be true)

- **Shift setup** is complete: see [`FRAPPE_SHIFT_SETUP.md`](./FRAPPE_SHIFT_SETUP.md)
  - Shift Types named `FT_{HHMM}_{HHMM}`.
  - Shift Schedules named `PAT_{DAYS}_{SHIFT_TYPE}[_{LUNCH_HINT}]`.
  - Employees assigned via **Shift Schedule Assignment** (creates dated Shift Assignments).
  - Lunch custom fields exist on Shift Type: `custom_lunch_start`, `custom_lunch_end`, `custom_grace_minutes`.
- **Checkin delivery** is stable: see [`FRAPPE_EMPLOYEE_CHECKIN.md`](./FRAPPE_EMPLOYEE_CHECKIN.md)
  - Idempotent inserts via `custom_supabase_log_id`.
  - Bridge sends `skip_auto_attendance = 1` on device punches.
- **Company timezone** is correct (attendance day boundaries).

## Data model assumptions

### Inputs

- **Employee Checkin**
  - `employee`
  - `time` (timezone-aware; stored as datetime)
  - `log_type` (IN/OUT if available; otherwise inferred)
  - `device_id` (optional but useful for debugging)
  - `skip_auto_attendance = 1`
  - `custom_supabase_log_id` (unique)
  - `custom_verify_type` (optional; informational)
- **Shift Assignment** (dated rows created from Shift Schedule Assignment)
  - employee + date → Shift Type for that date
- **Shift Type**
  - `start_time`, `end_time`
  - `custom_lunch_start`, `custom_lunch_end`, `custom_grace_minutes` (for full-day types)
- **Holiday List**
  - weekly off + public holidays

### Outputs (target shape)

**Persisted:** `Attendance Flag` rows (one per issue) — see [`FRAPPE_ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_PLAN.md`](./FRAPPE_ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_PLAN.md).

**Computed on read** (week/day API from checkins; not stored in MVP):

- **Derived times:** `first_in`, `last_out`, `lunch_out` / `lunch_in` (if present)
- **Durations:** `net_minutes`, `lunch_minutes` (observed vs expected)
- **Summary status:** worst open flag or `OK` (informational; payroll statuses deferred)

## Definitions

- **Attendance day**: local calendar day in **company timezone**.
- **On-shift**: employee has a dated Shift Assignment for that day.
- **Off-shift**: no Shift Assignment for that day or it’s a holiday/weekly-off.
- **Full-day shift**: a Shift Type where lunch fields are set.
- **Short shift**: a Shift Type without lunch fields (e.g. Saturday AM `FT_0800_1200`).

## Rule set (v0, MVP-compatible)

### 1) Determine expected shift for the day

For employee \(E\) on date \(D\):

- If \(D\) is a holiday / weekly off → **Off**.
- Else load Shift Assignment for \(E,D\).
  - If none → **Off** (or **Unassigned** if you want to track setup gaps).
  - Else shift type = `FT_*`.

### 2) Select relevant checkins for \(E,D\)

- Include all Employee Checkin rows for \(E\) whose `time` falls within:
  - \([D 00:00, D 23:59:59]\) in company timezone, **plus** an optional buffer window for near-midnight shifts (deferred).
- Sort ascending by time.

### 3) Identify primary punches

**MVP heuristic (device-agnostic):**

- `first_in` = earliest checkin time on \(D\)
- `last_out` = latest checkin time on \(D\)

If `log_type` is reliably populated:

- Prefer earliest `IN` for `first_in`
- Prefer latest `OUT` for `last_out`

### 4) Late start (flag)

Applies on **on-shift** days.

- Expected start = Shift Type `start_time`
- Grace = `custom_grace_minutes` (default 0 if unset)

Flag: **LATE_START** if:

- `first_in` exists and `first_in` > \(start + grace\)
- If `first_in` missing → handle by missing-punch rules below.

### 5) Lunch window (full-day shifts only)

If shift type has `custom_lunch_start` and `custom_lunch_end`:

- Expected lunch start/end define a *window*.
- Grace around lunch can reuse `custom_grace_minutes` or have its own (deferred).

MVP detection:

- Find the first checkin after `custom_lunch_start` and treat it as candidate lunch out/in pair.
- If you cannot find a reasonable pair, do not fabricate lunch; set lunch flags instead.

Flags:

- **MISSING_LUNCH**: no plausible lunch out/in pair detected.
- **LATE_FROM_LUNCH**: first checkin after expected lunch end (plus grace) is late.

### 6) Missing punches / insufficient data (flag)

Applies on **on-shift** days.

- **MISSING_ALL_PUNCHES**: no checkins on that day.
- **MISSING_IN_OR_OUT**: only one punch exists (cannot compute a work span).
- **SUSPICIOUS_SEQUENCE** (optional): too many punches, identical timestamps, etc.

### 7) Off-shift punches (flag)

If day is **off** but there are checkins:

- **OFF_SHIFT_PUNCH**: record punches but do not generate attendance status (MVP).

### 8) Work minutes (derived)

MVP:

- If `first_in` and `last_out` exist and `last_out` >= `first_in`:
  - `gross_minutes = last_out - first_in`
- If lunch detected and full-day:
  - `net_minutes = gross_minutes - lunch_minutes`
- Else:
  - `net_minutes = gross_minutes`

Later:

- cap extreme spans, handle multiple intervals, handle cross-midnight.

## Decisions deferred (explicitly out of MVP)

- Payroll statuses: Present / Half Day / Absent (based on working hours thresholds).
- Shift spanning midnight.
- Device-specific IN/OUT correctness and mapping (verify types).
- Automatic approvals / penalties.

## Review + approval workflow (proposed)

### Async on punch + nightly closeout

- **After each checkin:** worker refreshes AUTO `Attendance Flag` rows for that employee/date (coalesced).
- **Nightly / closeout:** absence flags for yesterday; set `day_closed` on AUTO flags.
- Never mutate historical **Employee Checkin** rows.

### HR review

- Inbox: `Attendance Flag` where `status = OPEN` (filter by `flag_code`, date, employee).
- HR can approve/reject or add `HR` source flag (e.g. official duty).

### Employee explanation

- Employee updates the **flag** row: `employee_note` + attachment → `status = EXPLAINED`.

### HR approval

On each **Attendance Flag**:

- **Approve** (`APPROVED`)
- **Reject** (`REJECTED`)
- **Close** without payroll impact (`CLOSED`) — e.g. acknowledged warning

## Pilot checklist (rules acceptance)

- [ ] Late start flags match manual expectations for 20 random days across 5 employees
- [ ] Lunch late flags match policy for full-day staff
- [ ] Saturday short shift does not raise lunch flags
- [ ] Off-shift punches are visible and do not create payroll status
- [ ] Edge cases documented (missing checkins, device downtime)
