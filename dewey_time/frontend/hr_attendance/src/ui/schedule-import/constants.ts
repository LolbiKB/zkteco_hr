/**

export const NORMALISATION_PROMPT = `Convert the schedule spreadsheet below into a CSV with exactly these 7 columns:

employee_id, email, am_from, am_to, pm_from, pm_to, days_off

Rules:
1. Times → HH:MM 24-hour format only. Examples:
   7:30am  → 07:30
   12:00pm → 12:00
   1:00pm  → 13:00
   5:00pm  → 17:00
   6:30am  → 06:30

2. pm_from / pm_to → write "off" if the employee has no afternoon shift.

3. days_off → pipe-separated list of weekday names the employee does NOT work.
   Append "(am)" to a day if the employee works that morning but not the afternoon.
   Use full weekday names: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday

   Examples:
     Works Mon–Fri full day, off Sat+Sun:
       days_off = Saturday|Sunday

     Works Mon–Fri full day + Sat morning only, off Sun:
       days_off = Saturday(am)|Sunday

     Works Mon–Fri mornings only, off Sat+Sun:
       pm_from = off   (already captured in column 5)
       days_off = Saturday|Sunday

4. Include a header row.
5. Output raw CSV only — no explanation, no markdown fences.
