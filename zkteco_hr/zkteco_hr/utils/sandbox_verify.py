"""Invariant oracle for the flag engine (the sandbox `verify` step).

Runs a battery of invariants over the AUTO-generated `Attendance Flag` rows and
emits findings as JSON. Two oracle layers:

  * crash oracle  — simply executing the queries against real (anonymized) data;
                    any exception surfaces as a failed `verify`.
  * invariant oracle — the pure functions below, each grounded in the engine's
                    actual control flow (attendance_engine/closeout.py +
                    intraday.py), not just plausible-sounding rules.

Each invariant is a PURE function (rows in, violating rows out) so it is unit
testable with no Frappe. `run()` is the only Frappe-touching part: it pulls the
rows + reference data and aggregates every invariant's hits into one findings
object, tagging each with its `invariant` name and a `kind`:

  * "contradiction" — the engine cannot produce this; a hit is almost certainly a bug.
  * "advisory"      — has a known-legitimate cause; a hit is worth a human look.
